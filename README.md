# Notechos

## Description:  
* The Notechos application is built for writing and saving notes to file. This enables a user to be organized and keep track of their ideas and retreive them later.
* Using an Express.js back end, data is saved and recalled from a JSON file. The user facing HTML interface lists the titles of saved notes to the left and their is an aempty field on the right  for the additio of a new note.
* As an app this may be used to integrate into other apps, or be used as a standalone to generate a note that will not persist when the application page is closed.
* A front to back end complete program deployed to heroku, Notechos codebase may be found in github.
